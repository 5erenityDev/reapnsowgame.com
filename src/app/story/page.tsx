          <p>Was it an accident or was it murder? Reap What You Sow is a horror themed farming simulator inspired by games like Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, and Story of Seasons. While you manage your crops and animals and tend to other farm activities, you also have to keep up appearances with the townsfolk as they ask what happened to your spouse, oblivious to the fact that you have killed them.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>Manage your farm over the course of the year with different seasons and crops. Spring crops in spring, summer crops in summer, etc. These crops can then be turned into different goods or sold as is. You can also raise animals on your farm to produce things like cloth and cheese. Interacting with the townsfolk will raise your friendship with them, with some being marriage candidates. There will also be different town events throughout the game such as holidays and other special occasions that will allow the player to increase their friendship with the townsfolk.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>The unique aspect of this game is the sanity system. Each day your characterâ€™s sanity will drain slowly as they are tormented by the memory of having killed their spouse. Your sanity will also drain depending on the actions you take, such as eating something bad for your character. This can lead to different things happening, such as hallucinations around the farm or during different activities, interactions with the townsfolk changing, or nightmares that the player will have to escape from. These will negatively impact the player, such as nightmares causing the player to have less energy for the next day. If your sanity gets too low your character will be admitted to the hospital. You can raise your sanity by purchasing medicine, participating in social events or talking to townsfolk, or by drinking alcohol.</p>
